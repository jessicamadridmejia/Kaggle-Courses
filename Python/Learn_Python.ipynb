The course is ideal for someone with some previous coding experience who wants to add Python to their repertoire or level up their basic Python skills. (If you're a first-time coder, you may want to check out [these \"Python for Non-Programmers\" learning resources](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers).)\n\nWe'll start with a brief overview of Python syntax, variable assignment, and arithmetic operators. If you have previous Python experience, you can [skip straight to the hands-on exercise](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels/fork/1275163).\n\n## Hello, Python!\nPython was named for the British comedy troupe [Monty Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python), so we'll make our first Python program an homage to their skit about Spam?\n\nJust for fun, try reading over the code below and predicting what it's going to do when run.

Generally, names that follow this double-underscore format have a special meaning to Python.\n\nSo, for example, the expression `x in [1, 2, 3]` is actually calling the list method `__contains__` behind-the-scenes.
